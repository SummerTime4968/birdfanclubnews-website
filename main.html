        <h1>Sorry, your news might be inside another bird's nest...</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately,We have decided to unplug our servers and offically shut down after we were
        informed that the discord server we get our news from, the Bird Fan Club discord server has shut down. We
        have served you continuous news for 52 days on events in the Bird Fan Club discord server and despite
        our best efforts to cover almost everything in the discord server, it ultimately shut down. We can't
        just leave the servers running only to not post anything on the website. If you have further questions,
        our email will still be up until February 21st, when it will also shut down. We're sorry guys, thanks for
        reading the articles that we post on this website. It was fun while it lasted, but it's time that we
        fly away from this website.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sincerely, the Bird Fan Club News Team.</p>

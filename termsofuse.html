        restricted parties.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
        these Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time
        thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Changes to These Terms of Use</h2>

        <h1>Li becomes jealous of those living in costal states!</h1>

        <p>Li has grew jealous to his friends who live near the coast, 
        after being sent their ocean pictures on the Discord. "I can't take 
        it anymore," said Li, who wished to not be landlocked. "Every time 
        I open Discord, I see them posting pictures of the ocean, or videos 
        of the ocean, or photos of them eating seafood. It's not fair. I'm 
        stuck here in this landlocked state, while they're living it up in 
        a costal state."</p>
        
        <p>Li said she has always dreamed of visiting the ocean, but she never 
        had the time or money to do so. "Now I have to watch my friends rub 
        it in my face, while I'm stuck with just lakes. She said she tried to 
        be happy for her friends, but she couldn't help feeling jealous and 
        resentful. She said she started to avoid responding to them.</p>

        <p>"I don't need that kind of negativity in my life," she said. "They're 
        not showing them to me, More like they're just flexing. They don't care 
        about me or how I feel. They're just trying to make me feel bad."</p>

        <p>Li said she hopes to move out of the landlocked state in the future.
        She also states that he has joined a support group for landlocked people
        online, where she can vent his frustrations and find solace. "We're all 
        in this together," she said. "We're the landlocked. We're the forgotten. 
        We're the ones who deserve to see the ocean."</p>

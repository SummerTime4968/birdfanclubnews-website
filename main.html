        <h1>Li threatens to do horrible things!</h1>

        <p>Li has caused some stir in the discord server after she announced that she would do horrible things
        tonight. Li, who lives in a landlocked state sent a message to the discord where she threatened to do
        horrible things. "I'm tired of not doing horrible things so I need to do some horrible things. You heard
        me, I'm serious. This is my ultimatum."</p>

        <p>The message in the discord quickly went viral in my brain, attracting thousands of brain neurons and
        reactions. Some praised Li for threatning to do horrible things, while others doubted her true nature and
        sincerity. Some even offered to help her with her war crimes, or to take them over if she failed.</p>
